### Objective

Your task is to build a full-stack todo app that aligns as closely as possible to the given design.

### Brief

Using TypeScript (Without Framework) for backend and React for frontend, your challenge is to construct the project according to the designs found in the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format, requiring you to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. A `style-guide.md` file is provided, containing essential information like the color palette and fonts.

**Client Side**

Users should be able to:

- Add new todos to the list.
- Mark todos as complete.
- Delete todos from the list.
- Filter by all/active/complete todos.
- Clear all completed todos.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- **Bonus**: Toggle between light and dark mode.
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list.

**Server Side**

- Design a simple API for persisting state on the server side.
- Implement routes for all listed **CRUD** operations.
- No authentication or session management is required. Imagine you are building this application for a single user (yourself).

### Evaluation Criteria

- Show us your work through your commit history.
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
- Completeness: Did you complete the features?
- Correctness: Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: Is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: Is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production, then push your changes to the master branch.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€
